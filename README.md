Prediction of SAE progression following onset of AE post-Shingles vaccination using the VAERS dataset.

Understanding the factors influencing serious adverse events (SAEs) following vaccination is
crucial among elderly population for informed decision-making. This study utilizes the Vaccine
Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) dataset to develop a predictive model for SAE
occurrence following the onset of adverse events (AEs) after immunization. Using natural
language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, we developed an AIbased
predictive model for SAE and identified key predictors of SAE, including specific medical
conditions, age, and gender. While this study demonstrates the potential of data-driven
approaches for vaccine safety monitoring among elderly population, it also indicates challenges
associated with VAERS dataset, and future research should aim to validate the findings in this
study. By providing insights into SAE occurrence after the onset of AEs, the purpose of this
study is to contribute to informative and personalized decisions, ultimately to enhance safety and
compliance of immunization.
